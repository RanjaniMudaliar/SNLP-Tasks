      "water, a woman standing on a narrow strip of beach, looking after it.  I\r\n",
      "was the woman left on the shore, the canoe held my companions of the past\r\n",
      "summer, the island was to be my home until another summer should bring\r\n",
      "them back again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is no denying that I was frightened as I turned back along the\r\n",
      "trail toward the little house among the birches.  It was hard work to\r\n",
      "keep from jumping into a boat and putting out after the canoe that was\r\n",
      "rounding the point and leaving me alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Little chilly fears laid icy fingers on the back of my neck.  A shadow\r\n",
      "slipped between the trees; a sigh whispered among the leaves.  I wanted\r\n",
      "to see all round me; I wanted to put my back against a wall.  A little,\r\n",
      "grinning goblin of a misgiving stuck out an impudent tongue as it quoted\r\n",
      "some of the jeers of unsympathetic friends and relatives, who had derided\r\n",
      "my plan for borrowing the camp, when summer was gone, and staying on\r\n",
      "alone at the Lake of Many Islands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGood-by,â had smiled my sister.  âYou say you mean to stay a year, but\r\n",

      "In vain I reminded her that no inhabitant seen in five summersâ sojourn\r\n",
      "at the lake had been without a nose or ears; all had had the requisite\r\n",
      "number of features, although some of those same features had withstood\r\n",
      "the cold of well-nigh a hundred winters.  But she was not consoled, and\r\n",
      "continued to regard me so tearfully that I felt sure that she was bidding\r\n",
      "farewell to my nose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYouâll break a leg and lie for days before anyone knows you are hurt,â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Descending from prophecy to argument, they continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOf course you will have a telephone.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat I will not,â I answered.  âI have been jerked at the end of a\r\n",
      "telephone wire for years.  I want rest.â\r\n",

      "âI donât want a companion,â I protested, tearfully.  âI wonât be\r\n",

      "alone or not at all.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am tired to death,â I stormed.  âI need rest for at least one year.  I\r\n",

      "paved streets, city smells and noise.  Instead of the clang of car bells\r\n",
      "and the honk of automobile horns, I want to hear the winds sing across\r\n",
      "the ice fields, instead of the smell of asphalt and hot gasoline, I want\r\n",
      "the odor of wet earth in boggy places.  I have loved the woods all my\r\n",
      "life, I long to see the year go round there just once before I die.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At which outburst they shrugged exasperated shoulders and were silent,\r\n",
      "but each one drew me aside, at parting, and pressed a gift into my hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBe sure to let us know if anything goes wrong.  Write to us if you need\r\n",
      "the least thing.  Donât be ashamed to come back, if the experiment proves\r\n",
      "a failureââand so on and so on, God bless them!\r\n",

      "Of all this the bogy reminded me as he danced ahead up the winding trail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The house looked lonely, even in the brightness of the late afternoon.  I\r\n",
      "hurried supper, to be indoors before the twilight fell.  Big Canadian\r\n",
      "hares hopped along the paths and sat at the kitchen door, their great\r\n",
      "eyes peering, long, furry ears alert, quivering noses pressed against the\r\n",
      "wire screen.  Grouse pecked on the hill side, as tame as barnyard fowl.\r\n",
      "From the water came the evening call of the loons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The scant meal finished, I ran across the platform from the kitchen to\r\n",
      "the main house and locked up.  Somehow, I did not want any open doors\r\n",
      "behind me that evening.  Then I loaded the pistol and laid it on a shelf\r\n",
      "at the head of the bed, along with the Bible and the Prayer Book.  If any\r\n",
      "marauder could know how dreadfully afraid I am of that pistol, he would\r\n",
      "do his marauding with a quiet mind.  I never expect to touch that weapon.\r\n",
      "It shall be cleaned and oiled when any of the men come over from the\r\n",
      "mainland, but handle itânever!  I would not fire it for a kingdom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While it was still light I climbed into bed, and lay down rigid, with\r\n",
      "tight-shut eyes, trying to pretend I did not hear all the rustling,\r\n",
      "creaking, snapping noises in the woods.  Heavy animals pushed through the\r\n",
      "fallen leaves.  Something that sounded as large as a moose went crashing\r\n",
      "through the dry bushes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA rabbit,â I whispered to myself.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âGrouse,â I tried to believe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the lake came stealthy sounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDriftwood pounding against the rocks, not really oars,â I murmured to my\r\n",
      "thumping heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then light, pattering footsteps on the porch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In desperation I raised my head and looked out.  It was a little red fox,\r\n",
      "trotting busily along, snuffling softly as he went.  I lay down and\r\n",
      "closed my eyes firmly, determined not to open them again no matter what\r\n",
      "might happen, then must have dozed, for, suddenly I was aware of a light\r\n",
      "that flooded all the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There through the northeast window, large and round and beautiful, shone\r\n",
      "the moon, the great Moon of the Falling Leaves.  It was like the sudden\r\n",
      "meeting with a friend, reassuring, comforting.  A broad band of light lay\r\n",
      "across my breast like a kind arm thrown over me.  The path of the\r\n",
      "moonbeams on the water seemed the road to some safe haven.  With the\r\n",
      "moonâs calm face looking in and the soft lapping of the waves as lullaby,\r\n",
      "I fell asleepâand lo! it was day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This house, the living room of the camp, that is to be my home for the\r\n",
      "coming winter, stands on a bluff overhanging the lake.  It is a one-room\r\n",
      "shack, 16Ã20 feet, surrounded by an eight-foot porch.  It is one-storied,\r\n",
      "shingled, the porch roof upheld by birch log pillars, beautiful still\r\n",
      "clothed in their silvery bark.  There are eight windows, two in each\r\n",
      "corner, and through some of them the sun is always shining.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adjoining this main shack and connected with it by an uncovered platform\r\n",
      "are the kitchen and storeroom, but these will not be used in winter.  The\r\n",
      "stores and I will have to stay in the big house if we are not to freeze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From these buildings little trails run off through the woods to the dock,\r\n",
      "the pump, the summer sleeping shacks, and a path goes all round the\r\n",
      "island close to the shore.  Away from these beaten tracks are all sorts\r\n",
      "of hidden nooks and lovely, dim seclusions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This little rocky island, one of scores that dot the face of the lake, is\r\n",
      "all a tangle of ferns and vines and wildflowers.  It is thickly wooded\r\n",
      "with white birch, poplar and wild cherry.  There are also oaks, maples,\r\n",
      "pines, and great clumps of basswood, and innumerable little cedars are\r\n",
      "pushing up everywhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Making a way through the overgrown paths in the early morning, I break\r\n",
      "through myriads of spiderwebs, stretched across from bushes heavy with\r\n",
      "dew.  They feel like the tiniest of fairy fingers brushing my cheek, and\r\n",
      "laid on my eyelids, light as the memory of a caress.  Butterflies dressed\r\n",
      "in black velvet, with white satin frills and sapphire jewels, flutter on\r\n",
      "ahead, and the stems of the birches are seen through a gold-green glow,\r\n",
      "like sunlight shining through clear water.  When I sit on the sandy\r\n",
      "bottom, with the whole lake for my washpot, small fishes, wearing coral\r\n",
      "buttons and jade green ruffles on fins and tails, bump their blunt noses\r\n",
      "against my knees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sounds from the mainland come across the lake, blurred and indistinct.\r\n",
      "On the island I hear only the wind in the trees, the water beating\r\n",
      "against the stones, and the hum of many insect wings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is something queer about the island.  I am convinced that it stands\r\n",
      "on some magnetic pole or other, that puts every clock and watch out of\r\n",
      "order as soon as it is landed here.  Cheap or fine, every timepiece\r\n",
      "breaks a mainspring, and then we fall back on the sundial to tell us\r\n",
      "whatâs oâclock.  We can always know when it is noon, provided the weather\r\n",
      "be sunny.  When it is cloudy we guess at the time and wait for the next\r\n",
      "fine day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This sundial stands in a clearing beside the house, and bears for its\r\n",
      "motto, not the high-sounding Latin quotation that seems to belong to\r\n",
      "sundials, but the trite assertion, âTime is valuable.â  A statement\r\n",
      "wholly untrue, so far as this present life of mine is concerned.  A fine\r\n",
      "bass, now, or a tin of beans perhaps is valuable, but surely not time, in\r\n",
      "a place where there is nothing to do but eat, sleep, and think.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet when I stood to-day, on this lonely bit of land, in the midst of an\r\n",
      "empty lake, waiting for the shadow to travel to the mark, I seemed to\r\n",
      "catch, for one fleeting instant, some idea of the terrible, inexorable\r\n",
      "passing of the hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSet thy house in order, set thy house in order,â something seemed to\r\n",

      "with the whirling of the spheres.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lake too has its mystery, a strange light that shines from the point\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âCrazy as a loon,â that is, of all phrases, the most libelous.  For the\r\n",
      "loon is the most sensible of fowl and possessed of the most distinct\r\n",
      "personality.  No other water bird has so direct and so level a flight.\r\n",
      "He lays his strong body down along the wind, and goes, like a bullet,\r\n",
      "straight to his goal, purposeful, unswerving.  He has three cries, one a\r\n",
      "high, maniac laugh, which is, of course, the reason his wits are\r\n",
      "slandered; then a loud, squealing cry, very like the sound of a pig in\r\n",

      "perhaps, that he sends out far across the waterâa cry that seems the very\r\n",
      "voice of the wilderness.  At twilight, and often in the night, I hear\r\n",

      "that covers every tree-trunk, rock, and stump, and turns the cedars to\r\n",
      "mounds of fluffy whiteness.  The paths lie under archways of bending,\r\n",
      "snow-laden branches, and all the underbrush is hidden.  The island wears\r\n",
      "many jewels, for every ice-incrusted twig flashes a cluster of diamonds,\r\n",
      "the orange berries of the bittersweet, each encased in clear ice, are\r\n",
      "like topaz, and the small frozen pools between the stones reflect the sky\r\n",
      "and shine like sapphires.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There have been snows since the first week in November, but this is the\r\n",
      "first that has remained, and how it shows the midnight activities of all\r\n",
      "the wild folk!  The porch floor is a white page on which they have left\r\n",
      "their signatures.  Here, by the storeroom door, are innumerable little\r\n",
      "stitch-like strokes.  They were made by the deer mouseâs wee paws.  There\r\n",
      "are the prints of the squirrelâs little hands and a long swathe, where\r\n",
      "his brush swept the snow.  The chickadees and nuthatches came very early.\r\n",
      "Their three-fingered prints are all over the woodpile, and on the paths\r\n",
      "are the blurred, ragged tracks left by the grouseâs snowshoes.  Over the\r\n",
      "hill runs a row of deep, round holes, showing that a fox has passed that\r\n",
      "way, and the rabbitâs tracks are everywhere.\r\n",

      "Every day the water freezes farther and farther out from the shores, and\r\n",
      "it is increasingly difficult to force a channel through it to the open\r\n",

      "and I land far away on the point and scramble through the bushes to the\r\n",
      "house when I must go over for the mail.  Frozen cascades hang down over\r\n",

      "She surveyed me with an appraising eye.  âWell now,â she said, kindly,\r\n",

      "naturally wear something dark and plain.â\r\n",

      "down the lake to the Jackson farm, following a fresh-cut sleigh track\r\n",
      "that glittered like a silver ribbon flung down on the blue ice.  Now and\r\n",

      "exactly on the stove, ventilation there was none, and the hall was\r\n",
      "packed, but what of that?  It was good to feel thoroughly warm, at no\r\n",

      "the causes that led to the Great War, and telling of Germanyâs policy and\r\n",
      "her hopes.  He explained the part that Belgium had played, in holding\r\n",
      "back the tide of invasion until France had had time to mobilize, and it\r\n",
      "was all very clear and convincing.  He laid stress on the spontaneous\r\n",
      "outpouring of loyalty in the colonies, and quoted one of the first\r\n",
      "messages received from Indiaâthe telegram from a Rajah that read: âMy\r\n",

      "her curly, dark hair.  Her assured manner struck me and not pleasantly.\r\n",
      "Later I understood it.  She was âTeacherâ in charge of Number Six, better\r\n",

      "that blotted out everything.  The lake was obscured, the outlines of the\r\n",

      "had undertaken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lake was like the ocean done in snow.  The wind had piled great\r\n",

      "wall, as I climbed through each succeeding hillock of snow and out across\r\n",
      "the intervening three or four yards of level ice.  Wave followed wave,\r\n",
      "each higher, deeper, more suffocating than the last.  Sometimes I could\r\n",
      "walk for a few feet on the top of a drift before sinking into its depths.\r\n",
      "I scrambled, fell, rolled, crawled, climbed, and thought that I should\r\n",
      "never reach the shore.  Counting helped me, as I pulled each foot up out\r\n",
      "of the clinging mass and set it down a few inches nearer the land.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOne, two, three, four,â I said aloud, timing my steps to the pounding of\r\n",

      "now with eyes shut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A thin, washed out moon came out and looked through wisps of ragged\r\n",
      "clouds.  Its light served only to make the scene more desolate, the\r\n",

      "my stupified brain was that I must somehow find strength to go on lifting\r\n",
      "heavy feet one after the other; that I must struggle up from each fall,\r\n",
      "must breathe deep and keep a quiet mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last I reached the deeper drifts that fringed the shore, skirted the\r\n",
      "hidden waterhole, found traces of the cattle tracks, dragged myself along\r\n",
      "the path and finally stepped, with the very last remnant of strength, up\r\n",
      "on the porch and into the warm bright kitchen.  When Mary Blake caught\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This time the wind was in my face, making the going ten times harder than\r\n",

      "the blast to catch my breath, and there was Henry, dressed in his great\r\n",
      "fur coat, striding out after me and looking for all the world like a bear\r\n",
      "on its hind legs.\r\n",

      "at the kitchen door, and even as early as ten oâclock it had eaten out a\r\n",

      "bright blue jersey and with a squirrel skin cap set at an angle over his\r\n",
      "dark, eager face.  Henry Blake was at the wheel, to take the sawed-off\r\n",
      "chunks from the feeders and throw them to the pile.  The rhythm of his\r\n",
      "movements was exact.  A reach toward the wheel, a heave, a toss over his\r\n",
      "shoulder to the ever-increasing pile of chunks and a return to the\r\n",
      "wheelâall this at the rate of a chunk every three seconds.  This\r\n",

      "GOOD FRIDAY, a heavy fall of snow and winter come again.  The ground is\r\n",
      "white, the sky dull gray, the lake a dark, bluish green flecked with\r\n",
      "windrows of snow.  It is more than a week since I have walked on the ice.\r\n",
      "It bids fair to be two weeks before I can cross in a boat.  At this rate\r\n",
      "the ice will never breakâI had to chop out the water hole again this\r\n",
      "morning.  This waiting for the ice to go out is like waiting for a child\r\n",
      "to be born, and it seems almost as solemn.  It induces a calm,\r\n",
      "philosophic, not to say fatalistic, viewpoint.  You canât hurry it, you\r\n",
      "canât stop it, you canât do anything at all about it.  You can only wait.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again, as in the fall when the ice was forming, there is that strange\r\n",
      "blanket of silence over the island.  Thereâs not a rustle in the dry\r\n",
      "leaves, not a birdâs voice, not even the scraping of a hanging bough.\r\n",
      "The ice field is growing darker, wetter, and cracking into long lines\r\n",
      "that form geometric figuresâsquares, triangles, trapezoidsâuntil the\r\n",
      "lakeâs surface looks like a gigantic spiderâs web.  For movement there is\r\n",
      "only the water along the shores, creeping up over the stones.\r\n",

      "that boys loveâneither a circus, nor a picture, nor had ever heard a\r\n",
      "band.  They had never been allowed to go even to Frontenac, the county\r\n",
      "seat, ten miles away.  All they knew about was work and heavy sleep and\r\n",
      "now and then a beating.  But they were boys after all, and one bright day\r\n",
      "they slipped away from the harvest field and went to the lake to go\r\n",
      "afishing.  Hearing footsteps and fearing their fatherâs anger, they tried\r\n",
      "to escape it.  The younger boy jumped into a rotting punt at the shore\r\n",
      "and pushed off on the water.  The elder hid behind a rock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Out on the lake the old punt filled and began to sink.  The little\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "were locked in one anotherâs arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A commonplace story, isnât it?  Such accidents happen almost every\r\n",
      "dayâsomewhere.  Thereâs nothing at all in it but childish joy in freedom,\r\n",
      "dread of punishment, terror, then love and sacrifice, and, crowning all,\r\n",
      "heroic death.  I think of them not as âsaints in gloryâ but as happy\r\n",

      "loaves of bread, a pat of fresh butterâa great bag of mail and a box of\r\n",
      "candy and fruitâthe Easter greeting from home.  The water was flowing all\r\n",
      "round the shore; Jimmie could not come within many feet of the island,\r\n",

      "The woodchuck, that lives in a hole by the sundial, comes out and waddles\r\n",

      "turns his ratâs face up to the sky, glancing hurriedly from side to side,\r\n",
      "his little pig eyes rolling, the white ring of hairs surrounding his\r\n",

      "acknowledge having shot him; indeed, it would be a hard-hearted hunter\r\n",

      "cow stable, that came over the ice to me on the crisp, frosty air, but\r\n",
      "now there is a very riot of perfume.  The rotting leaves, the barks of\r\n",

      "IT is wild strawberry time in lower Canada.  The fields are carpeted with\r\n",
      "them and the fern-covered rocks hold each a little garden where the red\r\n",
      "berries hang over the water like rubies in a setting of clustered leaves.\r\n",
      "The birds are feasting royally and I walk along the edges of the meadows,\r\n",
      "gathering handfuls of the ripe fruit.  No one is at home any more.  When\r\n",
      "I stop at a house the women have all gone a-berrying.  Thousands of\r\n",
      "quarts go off to the markets, or are cooked here into jellies and jam,\r\n",
      "for the delicacy of the winter is wild strawberry preserve.  I had it\r\n",
      "every time I went out to tea.  Now they give me strawberry shortcake and,\r\n",
      "O how good it is!  No garden fruit can compare, in sweetness or perfume,\r\n",
      "with the little wild berry of the fields.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not all my friends go berrying every day, however.  Yesterday I was\r\n",
      "kneeling on the dock busy washing my clothes, when a heavily laden motor\r\n",
      "boat, with a row boat in tow, rounded the point and headed for the\r\n",
      "island.  In it were Mary Blake, Mrs. Swanson, Anna Jackson, and Jean\r\n",
      "Foret.  Rose Beaulac and Granny Drapeau sat in the little boat behind and\r\n",
      "all space not filled by women of ample build, was piled high with pails\r\n",
      "and baskets.\r\n",

      "women of affairsâlaid aside their cares, forgot their responsibilities\r\n",
      "and enjoyed their party with the simplicity of children.  And how good\r\n",
      "was the chicken, brought already cooked in a shining pail, and the cakes\r\n",
      "and pies in the baskets!  Mrs. Swanson had journeyed in to Sark to buy\r\n",
      "candy, and all that the store there boasted was the dear old candy of our\r\n",

      "rather, they talked; I listened, marking the shrewdness of their\r\n",
      "deductions, the keenness of their comment, the kindliness of their\r\n",
      "judgments.  I heard all about the fine new store at Frontenac and the\r\n",
      "bargains one and another had found.  They described the magnificence of\r\n",
      "the yearly celebration there when the Orangemen walk in procession.  They\r\n",
      "told me that this year Joey Trueman, the storekeeper, had not scrupled to\r\n",

      "to the dock, I tried to say something of what lies in my heart about all\r\n",
      "the kindness they had shown me in the year gone by, but the lump that\r\n",
      "rose in my throat choked back the words.  They climbed into their boats,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "common due of mankindâlike air and sunshine, warm fires and the kind\r\n",

      "crawling up from the water and out on a board.  It moved with such effort\r\n",
      "and seemed so weak that I was tempted to put it out of its pain.  But if\r\n",
      "I have learned nothing else in all these months in the woods, I have\r\n",
      "thoroughly learned to keep hands off the processes of nature.  Too often\r\n",
      "have I seen my well-meant attempts to help things along end in disaster.\r\n",
      "So I gave the creature another glance and prepared to go about my\r\n",
      "business, when I noticed a slit in its humped back, and a head with\r\n",
      "great, dull beads of eyes pushing out through the opening.  Then I sat\r\n",
      "down to watch, for I realized that this was birth and not death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Very slowly the head emerged and the eyes began to glow like lamps of\r\n",
      "emerald light.  A shapeless, pulpy body came working out and two feeble\r\n",
      "legs pushed forth and began groping for a firm hold.  They fastened on\r\n",
      "the board and then, little by little and ever so slowly, the whole insect\r\n",
      "struggled out, and lay weak, almost inanimate, beside the empty case that\r\n",
      "had held it prisoner so long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two crumpled lumps on either side began to unfurl and show as wings.  The\r\n",
      "long abdomen, curled round and under, like a snail-shell, began to uncurl\r\n",
      "and change to brilliant green, while drops of clear moisture gathered on\r\n",
      "its enameled sides and dripped from its tip.  The transparent membrane of\r\n",
      "the wings, now held stiffly erect, began to show rainbow colors, as they\r\n",
      "fanned slowly in the warm air, and, at last, nearly three hours after the\r\n",
